I’ve tried the new moon tilted in the air<br />
Above a hazy tree-and-farmhouse cluster<br />
As you might try a jewel in your hair.<br />
I’ve tried it fine with little breadth of luster,<br />
Alone, or in one ornament combining<br />
With one first-water star almost as shining.<br />
<br />
I put it shining anywhere I please.<br />
By walking slowly on some evening later,<br />
I’ve pulled it from a crate of crooked trees,<br />
And brought it over glossy water, greater,<br />
And dropped it in, and seen the image wallow,<br />
The color run, all sorts of wonder follow.<br />
